![kirby](./static/kirby.png)

Kirby is my home manager configuration, it lets you customize on different machines and as different users, while sharing the same configurations for commonly used programs. `program/` and `service/` folders contains configurations that can be reused, `machine/` and `user` are used to build the final system.
